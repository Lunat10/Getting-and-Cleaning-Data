Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
Dataset: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

Files: CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations

The run_analysis.R performs the data preparation for the course assignment for the dataset above, the script runs these series below:
-Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
-Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
-From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
